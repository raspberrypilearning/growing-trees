## The impact on C02 levels

Trees are extremely important to our quality of life on land. From trees people get fruits to eat, oils for healthy living and shelter from the weather. They are also home to many different species of animals.

Trees also absorb carbon dioxide and help to reduce the rate of CO2 emitted across the globe. A typical hardwood tree can absorb as much as 48 pounds of carbon dioxide per year. Trees help protect our planet!

Add a variable to your simulation to calculate the current amount of CO2 that would be absorbed by your fully-grown trees each year.
