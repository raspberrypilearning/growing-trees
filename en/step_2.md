## Create a forest

Did you know that forests cover 30% of the Earthâ€™s land surface? In this step you will add code to create a forest with a variety of different trees.

If working **online**, open the [starter project](http://rpf.io/p/en/projectName-on){:target="_blank"} in Scratch.

If working **offline**, open the project [starter file](http://rpf.io/p/en/projectName-get){:target="_blank"} in the Scratch offline editor. If you need to download and install Scratch, you can find it [here](https://scratch.mit.edu/download){:target="_blank"}.

You should see a green grassland background.

--- /task ---

Use a loop to plant 50 trees to start your forest.

--- task ---

Go to the Sprites pane and click on the **Tree** sprite. Drag a `when flag clicked`{:class="block3events"} block and `repeat 10`{:class="block3control"} block onto your Code area. For the `repeat 10`{:class="block3control"} block change the value `10` to `50`.

```blocks3
when flag clicked
repeat (50)
```

--- /task ---

Plant the new trees in random positions across the stage.

--- task ---

Use a `go to random position`{:class="block3motion"} block to vary where the trees grow. Then add a `create clone of myself`{:class="block3control"} block to create the forest.

```blocks3
when flag clicked
repeat (50)
+go to [random position v]
+create clone of [myself v]
end
```
