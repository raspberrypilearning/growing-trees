## What next?

In this project, you have:

+ Used `clone`{:class="block3control"} blocks to generate trees in `random`{:class="block3operators"} locations
+ Used `>`{:class="block3operators"} `<`{:class="block3operators"} operators to control the human character to alert the user about the state of the environment
+ Programmed a simulation to explore the impact of humans on trees and the surrounding wildlife

If you are following the [Protect our planet](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/raspberrypi/protect-our-planet) projects, then try out the next project, [Electricity generation](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/electricity-generation). In this project, you will create a program to input real data on the range of natural resources used by countries to generate electricity. Then, you will compare the results using animated and interactive data visualisation.
