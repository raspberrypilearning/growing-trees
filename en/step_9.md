## What next?

In this project, you have:

+ Used `clones`{:class="block3control"} to generate trees in `random`{:class="block3operators"} locations
+ Used `>`{:class="block3operators"} `<`{:class="block3operators"} `operators`{:class="block3operators"} to control when the human character alerts the user about the state of the environment
+ Programmed a simulation to explore the impact of humans on trees and the surrounding wildlife.

If you are following the [Protect our planet](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/raspberrypi/protect-our-planet) pathway, you can move on to the [Electricity generation](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/electricity-generation) project. In this project, you will create a program to input real data on the range of natural resources used by various countries to generate electricity. Then compare the results using animnated and interactive data visualisation.
