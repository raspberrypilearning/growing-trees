## What next?

In this project, you have:

+ Created and used `variables`{:class="block3variables"} to store numbers
+ Used `motion`{:class="block3motion"} and `looks`{:class="block3looks"} to create an animation
+ Explored the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals which focus on the importance of trees

If you are following the [Protect our planet](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/raspberrypi/protect-our-planet) pathway, you can move on to the [Electricity generation](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/electricity-generation) project. In this project, you will create a program to input real data on the range of natural resources used by various countries to generate electricity. Then compare the results using animnated and interactive data visualisation.

If you want to have more fun exploring Scratch, then you could try out any of [these projects](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects?software%5B%5D=scratch&curriculum%5B%5D=%201).
