## Introduction

Use Scratch to create a simulation that shows how varying how well an area of land is managed and altering amounts of deforestation will impact trees, wildlife and the environment.

This project focuses on three of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals:

+ [Responsible Consumption and Production](https://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-12-responsible-consumption-and-production.html){:target="_blank"}
+ [Climate Action](https://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-13-climate-action.html){:target="_blank"}
+ [Life on Land](https://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-15-life-on-land.html){:target="_blank"}

Thanks to Ecosia for their guidance on tree life simulation.

### What you will make

--- no-print ---
Click on the green flag and then move the slider to alter the tree management levels. Click on the tree feller to request wood. Keep an eye out for natural disasters though - theyâ€™re very disruptive!
